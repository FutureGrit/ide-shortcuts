# ide-shortcuts

This page lists keyboard shortcuts for the Android Studio that I find valuable and use a lot while working on flutter. Feel free to fork the page and add your own favorites. Pull Requests welcome!

This list is by no means meant to be a complete listing of every available shortcut. It simply lists the shortcuts that I use on a regular basis.

Since I'm using a Windows, I have mainly listed the keyboard shortcuts Windows. Please feel free to add the macOS or Linux shortcuts.

| Command | Windows | Description |

| Code Structure | Ctrl + Alt + L | Fix the code structure |
| Rename | Shift + F6 | Refactor the name of class or file |
